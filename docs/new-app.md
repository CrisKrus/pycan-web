# Adding a new section (app) to the project

Normally, when a new app (section) is needed in a Django project, it can be created as follows:

```console
$ ./manage.py startapp <app>
```

Based on the design of our project, some further steps must be taken in order to get the app well visualized:

1. Add `<app>` to the `APPS` constant on [gulp/config.js](gulp/config.js).
2. Create the file `<app>/static/<app>/css/main.scss` with, at least, the following content: `@import "commons/static/commons/css/base";`
3. Create the base template file at `<app>/templates/<app>/base.html` which extends from [commons/templates/base.html](commons/templates/base.html) as `base.html` and links to the stylesheet `<app>/custom.min.css` (_this file is generated by gulp_)
4. In order to create the corresponding item on header menu, add the app entry at [commons/templates/header.html](commons/templates/header.html).
